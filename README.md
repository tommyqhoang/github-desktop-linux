# GitHub Desktop for Linux

[![Linux Packages](https://github.com/tommyqhoang/github-desktop-linux/actions/workflows/ci-linux.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tommyqhoang/github-desktop-linux/actions/workflows/ci-linux.yml)

This repository maintains a Linux-focused fork of
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), the open-source
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app written in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The previous Linux fork went quiet for several years. This project is taking
over maintenance with a practical goal: keep GitHub Desktop usable on Linux,
catch up important Windows/macOS Desktop features where possible, and ship
installable Linux packages directly from GitHub.

## Current Focus

- Keep the Linux app building and installable.
- Continue catching up high-value Desktop workflows such as Git hooks,
  multi-domain account flows, security status links, and GitHub browser
  shortcuts.
- Prefer small, tested, end-to-end feature slices over large rewrites.
- Publish user-installable `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.AppImage` artifacts from
  GitHub Actions.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the active catch-up roadmap.

## Linux Catch-up Features

This fork includes Linux-focused catch-up work on top of the upstream GitHub
Desktop codebase:

- **AI commit messages**: generate commit summaries and descriptions from the
  currently selected changes. Configure OpenRouter in Preferences, choose the
  model and base URL, and optionally disable generation per repository in
  Repository Settings.

- **AI-native workflow**: four one-shot AI actions that reuse the same
  OpenRouter provider as AI commit messages — generate a **pull request
  description** (title + body) from the branch's commits and diff, **summarize**
  a set of changes or a commit in plain language, **review your changes** before
  committing (severity-tagged findings), and get **merge-conflict assistance**
  that explains a conflict and suggests a resolution. Each shows in a shared
  result dialog with Copy/Regenerate. Reach the review/summarize actions from
  the command palette and PR descriptions from the "Open pull request" dialog.
- **Command palette**: a fuzzy action launcher opened with `Ctrl/Cmd+K` —
  jump to repository sections, push/pull/fetch, create a branch, toggle the
  terminal, open preferences, or run the AI actions, all from the keyboard.
- **Git blame**: a per-line blame gutter in the Files viewer (toggle **Blame**)
  showing the author and short SHA that last touched each line, with contiguous
  runs of the same commit collapsed.
- **In-file find**: `Ctrl/Cmd+F` in the Files viewer opens a find bar with a
  match count and next/previous navigation that highlights the active match.
- **Commit graph**: the History list draws branch/merge topology as colored
  lane lines beside each commit.
- **Submodules management**: a Submodules tab listing each submodule with its
  checked-out commit, status (uninitialized / out-of-date / conflicted), and
  actions to update (init + checkout) all or one, and to sync remote URLs.
- **Integrated terminal**: a repo-scoped terminal panel docked at the bottom of
  the window, toggled with `` Ctrl+` ``. It runs real shell sessions
  (`node-pty` + `xterm.js`) with multiple tabs and per-repository session
  persistence.
- **Files browser**: a read-only Files tab with a working-tree file tree and a
  multi-tab viewer. Open several files at once (reorder tabs by dragging, close
  via the per-tab button, middle-click, or a right-click menu with close
  others/left/right/all), with syntax highlighting, rendered Markdown, CSV/TSV
  tables, inline image/video preview, and "open in browser" for HTML/PDF.
  Right-click tree entries to rename, trash, copy paths, or open in your editor.
- **Interactive rebase**: a planning dialog to reorder, squash, fixup, and drop
  a range of recent commits, then run a single `git rebase -i` through Desktop's
  multi-commit-operation machinery with progress and undo.
- **Repository health dashboard**: a cross-repository status view showing
  uncommitted files, ahead/behind counts, open pull request count,
  default-branch CI status, and a per-repository attention score, with sorting,
  filtering, and refresh. Signal cells drill down — click one to open that
  repository on the relevant tab (changes → Changes, ahead/behind → History,
  CI → Actions).
- **In-app pull request review**: review a pull request without leaving the
  app — load its review threads, draft line comments, set a verdict (approve,
  request changes, or comment), and submit the review in one shot.
- **Stash management**: a Stashes tab listing every stash entry — created by
  Desktop or the Git CLI — with apply and create-with-message actions.
- **Worktrees management**: a Worktrees tab listing the repository's linked
  worktrees with each one's checked-out branch, uncommitted-change count, and
  locked/prunable state — and actions to add a worktree (on a new or existing
  branch), remove one, and prune stale entries.
- **GitHub Actions workflow runs**: an Actions tab listing recent workflow
  runs with status icons, filterable by state (queued, in-progress, completed,
  success, failure, cancelled), and a "Run workflow" button that opens a
  dispatch dialog with a workflow dropdown and branch input.
- **Working-directory change summary**: the Changes tab shows aggregate
  added/removed line counts next to the changed-file count.
- **Changed-file filtering**: filter the Changes view by path using one or more
  case-insensitive search terms while keeping the existing file selection flow.
- **Organization diagnostics**: see visible organizations for each signed-in
  GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise account in Preferences, with guidance for
  common missing-organization causes such as OAuth app restrictions, SAML SSO,
  private membership, and repository permissions.
- **Manual Linux release builds**: maintainers can run the `CI / Linux`
  workflow manually for a branch, tag, or SHA and produce `.AppImage`, `.deb`,
  `.rpm`, and `.sha256` artifacts, with optional draft GitHub Release creation.

## Download and Install

Packages are distributed through GitHub Actions artifacts and GitHub Releases.
Package-manager feeds from older Linux forks are no longer the primary
distribution path for this project.

1. Open the
   [CI / Linux workflow](https://github.com/tommyqhoang/github-desktop-linux/actions/workflows/ci-linux.yml).
2. Choose the latest successful run, or a tagged draft release when available.
3. Download the artifact for your architecture:
   - `ubuntu-amd64-artifacts`
   - `ubuntu-arm64-artifacts`
   - `ubuntu-arm-artifacts`
4. Extract the artifact and install one package:
   - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ./GitHubDesktop-linux-*.deb`
   - Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE: install the `.rpm` with your package manager.
   - Any supported Linux distribution: mark the `.AppImage` executable and run
     it.

Example AppImage install:

```sh
chmod +x GitHubDesktop-linux-*.AppImage
./GitHubDesktop-linux-*.AppImage
```

Example Debian package install:

```sh
sudo apt install ./GitHubDesktop-linux-*.deb
```

## Manual Release Builds

Maintainers build Linux packages with the `CI / Linux` GitHub Actions workflow.
Use **Run workflow**, choose the branch/tag/SHA to build, and leave
`publish_release` disabled for artifact-only validation builds.

To create a draft GitHub Release, run the same workflow with:

- `publish_release`: enabled
- `release_tag`: a tag such as `release-3.4.9-linux1`

The workflow builds `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.sha256` files for the
supported Linux architectures. Users can download these files directly from the
workflow artifacts or from the draft release after it is reviewed and published.

## Development

This repository uses Yarn 1.x and Node `20.17.0`.

```sh
yarn
yarn build:dev
yarn start
```

Useful checks:

```sh
yarn test
yarn lint
yarn compile:dev
```

## Known Issues

Linux-specific issues and workarounds are tracked in
[docs/known-issues.md](docs/known-issues.md#linux). Some older documentation in
`docs/` still refers to the previous fork and upstream release process; prefer
this README and `TODO.md` for current project direction.

## Relationship to Upstream

This project is based on GitHub Desktop but is not an official GitHub product
release channel. We will continue to reference upstream
[`desktop/desktop`](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) for architecture,
bugfixes, and feature parity, while maintaining Linux packaging and Linux-first
fixes here.
