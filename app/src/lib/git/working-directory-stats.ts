/**
 * Compute aggregate diff statistics for the working directory.
 *
 * The stats cover every pending change — tracked modifications,
 * tracked deletions, and brand-new untracked files. `git diff HEAD`
 * on its own ignores untracked files, so to include them the changes
 * are staged with `--intent-to-add` into a throwaway index and then
 * diffed against HEAD. The throwaway index keeps the repository's
 * real index untouched, and `--intent-to-add` records only the path
 * (no blob is written to the object database).
 *
 * Binary files appear as `-\t-\t` and are counted as 0 additions /
 * 0 deletions. Files ignored via .gitignore are excluded.
